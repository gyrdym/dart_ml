/// A class that performs linear regression
///
/// A typical linear regressor uses the equation of a line for multidimensional
/// space to make a prediction. Each `x` in the equation has its own coefficient
/// (weight) and the combination of these `x`-es and its coefficients gives the
/// `y` term. The latter is a value that the regressor should predict, and
/// as all the `x` values are known (since it is the input for the algorithm),
/// the regressor should find the best coefficients (weights) (they are unknown)
/// to make a best prediction of `y` term.
abstract class LinearRegressor implements Assessable, Serializable, Predictor {
  /// Parameters:
  ///
  /// [fittingData] A [DataFrame] with observations, that will be used by the
  /// regressor to learn coefficients of the predicting hyperplane. Must contain
  /// [targetName] column.
  ///
  /// [targetName] A string, that serves as a name of the target column, that
  /// contains labels or outcomes.
  ///
  /// [optimizerType] Defines an algorithm of optimization, that will be used
  /// to find the best coefficients of a cost function. Also defines, which
  /// regularization type (L1 or L2) one may use to learn a linear regressor.
  /// By default - [LinearOptimizerType.gradient].
  ///
  /// [iterationsLimit] A number of fitting iterations. Uses as a condition of
  /// convergence in the optimization algorithm. Default value is `100`.
  ///
  /// [initialLearningRate] A value, defining velocity of the convergence of the
  /// gradient descent optimizer. Default value is `1e-3`.
  ///
  /// [minCoefficientsUpdate] A minimum distance between coefficient vectors in
  /// two contiguous iterations. Uses as a condition of convergence in the
  /// optimization algorithm. If difference between the two vectors is small
  /// enough, there is no reason to continue fitting. Default value is `1e-12`
  ///
  /// [lambda] A coefficient of regularization. Uses to prevent the regressor's
  /// overfitting. The more the value of [lambda], the more regular the
  /// coefficients of the equation of the predicting hyperplane are. Extremely
  /// large [lambda] may decrease the coefficients to nothing, otherwise too
  /// small [lambda] may be a cause of too large absolute values of the
  /// coefficients, that is also bad.
  ///
  /// [regularizationType] A way the coefficients of the regressor will be
  /// regularized to prevent a model overfitting.
  ///
  /// [randomSeed] A seed, that will be passed to a random value generator,
  /// used by stochastic optimizers. Will be ignored, if the solver cannot be
  /// stochastic. Remember, each time you run the stochastic regressor with the
  /// same parameters but with unspecified [randomSeed], you will receive
  /// different results. To avoid it, define [randomSeed].
  ///
  /// [batchSize] A size of data (in rows), that will be used for fitting per
  /// one iteration. Applicable not for all optimizers. If gradient-based
  /// optimizer is used and If [batchSize] == `1`, stochastic mode will be
  /// activated; if `1` < [batchSize] < `total number of rows`, mini-batch mode
  /// will be activated; if [batchSize] == `total number of rows`, full-batch
  /// mode will be activated.
  ///
  /// [fitIntercept] Whether or not to fit intercept term. Default value is
  /// `false`. Intercept in 2-dimensional space is a bias of the line (relative
  /// to X-axis).
  ///
  /// [interceptScale] A value, defining a size of the intercept.
  ///
  /// [isFittingDataNormalized] Defines, whether the [fittingData] normalized
  /// or not. Normalization should be performed column-wise. Normalized data
  /// may be needed for some optimizers (e.g., for
  /// [LinearOptimizerType.coordinate]).
  ///
  /// [learningRateType] A value, defining a strategy for the learning rate
  /// behaviour throughout the whole fitting process.
  ///
  /// [initialCoefficientsType] Defines the coefficients, that will be
  /// autogenerated at the first iteration of optimization. By default,
  /// all the autogenerated coefficients are equal to zeroes at the start.
  /// If [initialCoefficients] are provided, the parameter will be ignored.
  ///
  /// [initialCoefficients] Coefficients to be used in the first iteration of
  /// optimization algorithm. [initialCoefficients] is a vector, length of which
  /// must be equal to the number of features in [fittingData]: the number of
  /// features is equal to the number of columns in [fittingData] minus 1
  /// (target column).
  ///
  /// [dtype] A data type for all the numeric values, used by the algorithm. Can
  /// affect performance or accuracy of the computations. Default value is
  /// [DType.float32].
